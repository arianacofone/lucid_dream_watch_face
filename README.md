As a huge fan of Pebble watches, I wanted to create my own watchface. With an afternoon free, I jumped into Pebble's documentation and learned to code in C for the first time. A couple hours later, I published my creation on their <a target="_blank" href="https://apps.getpebble.com/en_US/application/57ec63973095e34b9e000245?query=lucid&section=watchfaces">app store</a> and am wearing it on my wrist!
