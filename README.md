As a huge fan of Pebble watches, I wanted to create my own watch face inspired by lucid dreaming. After diving into Pebble's documentation and their cloud platform, I am beyond impressed. You can either code the watchface in Javascript or C and within that language, customize the watchface to your hearts content. If you own a Pebble watch, you can download my creation in their <a href="https://apps.getpebble.com/en_US/application/57ec63973095e34b9e000245?query=lucid&section=watchfaces', '_blank'">app store</a>!
